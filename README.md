# 🐍 Python Topic Practice Programs 📚

Welcome to my personal Python practice repository!  
As a student 💼 learning programming step by step, I'm using this space to build a strong foundation by practicing problems from different Python topics using only:

- Loops 🔁  
- Conditional Statements ⚖️  
- Core Logic 💡

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

I'm preparing for coding interviews and college placements by mastering the basics without using shortcuts like libraries or built-in methods (`max()`, `min()`, etc.).  
This repo helps me — and hopefully others too — improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
